Why Ansible?
*Ansible is Push mechanism model
ex: install packages
Execute and push the configuration to multiple servers

*Agentless model
Not master slave architecture

*dynamic inventory
Auto detect the new instance and set the configuration and will management automatically

*pretty easy with windows and linux

*ansible is using global language i.e., yaml not need to learn new language like puppet language

Drawbacks:
users with windows OS have slight problems even with advanced ansible modules
debugging mechanism is not upto the mark along with performance while doing parallel executions
