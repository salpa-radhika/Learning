Installation process:
from the instance run below commands:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
ansible --version


prerequisites for password less auth:
create multiple servers(2)
generate keys using ssh-keygen command get the keys from .ssh/id_rsa.pub(public key) and insert that data in second servers .ssh/authorised_keys file
ssh second_server_private_ip
works!


The files created in ansible are called as playbooks
Commands in ansible are called as ansible adhoc commands

Sample commands 

1)create a sample file in diff server:
*for this create inventory file with private ip address of second server
command -> ansible -i inventory[name of the inventory file] all[--lists-hosts] -a "touch file"[arguments] -m 'shell' [module]
*cross check if file created in second server

Note: Default inventory file will be available in sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts


2)check the connection of client servers

ansible -i inventory all -m ping
ansible -i inventory client_server -m ping

3)Check if there are any files or directories 

ansible -i inventory[0] -m "shell" -a "ls -l"
ansible -i inventory client_server -m "shell" -a "ls -l"

4)Copy files across the remote nodes

ansible -i inventory all -m "copy" -a "src=./test dest=test1 mode=u-w,g+x,o-r"
ansible -i inventory client_server -m "copy" -a "src=./test dest=test1 mode=u-x"

5)setup module:This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks. 

ansible -i inventory client_server -m setup
ansible -i inventory client_server -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_os_family'

6)the highest cpu consuming processes you can use top command.
ansible -i inventory client_server -m shell -a "top | head -1"

7)list down the processes with higher memory consumption
ansible -i inventory client_server -m shell -a "ps -ef | head -15"
